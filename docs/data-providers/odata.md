# OData

The [OData (Open Data) protocol](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/) is a standard for specifying REST endpoint services.

The Builder supports:
* For Angular, OData version 4.
* For AngularJS, OData versions 2, 3, and 4.

> When you first create your application, you might choose to relate it to a data provider that will not be the real data provider for the published application. To override the test URL of that data provider:
>   1. Generate the application.
>   2. For Angular, go to `../app/src/environments/` and update the file you need. For AngularJS, update the `../app/src/data-providers.json` file.

## Setting OData Providers

> All **Name** fields are restrictive. If the symbols you placed in them are not supported, the Builder displays the `Invalid format. Only letters, numbers, "_" and "-" are allowed.` error message.

1. On the Dashboard, click the card (or list item) of the application to open the **App Design** page.
1. On the **App Design** page, click **Add Data Provider**. As a result, the **Add Data Provider** dialog box appears.
1. Select the **OData** data provider.
1. In **Name**, provide the name of the data provider.
1. In **Service URI**, enter the URI of the OData Service. For example, http://Your-IP-Address:8980/OData/Inventory.svc.
1. (Optional) Test whether the URI is working by clicking **Test Connection**.
1. (Optional) By default, the **Auto-create Data Sources** checkbox is selected. This means that the Builder automatically generates and relates the data sources based on the defined resources in **Service URI** or `$metadata`.

  > If you deselect the **Auto-create Data Sources** checkbox, you have to manually create and set up the data sources after the data provider is created. For more information, refer to the article on [data sources]({% slug datasources_kuib %}).

1. In **Authentication Type**, select the security model for the service and catalog URI. The model has to match the authentication model of the web application (web server) which provides the data object service. All authentication types strictly follow the protocol specifications. For more information, refer to the article on [authentication]({% slug authentication_kuib %}).

  * **None**&mdash;Indicates that the provider data is not protected by authentication.
  * **OpenID Connect**&mdash;Indicates that the provider data is protected through an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
  * (Angular only) **OAuth 2.0**&mdash;Indicates that the provider data is protected for authorization through the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
  * (Angular only) **Basic**&mdash;Indicates that the provider data is protected with a username and a password that are required when the user makes a request.
  * (Angular only) **API Key**&mdash;Indicates that the provider data is protected with an API key token that is required when the user makes API calls.

1. Click **Add Data Provider** to save the settings of the data provider and close the **Add Data Provider** dialog box. As a result, the **App Design** page displays the card for the newly added data provider.
